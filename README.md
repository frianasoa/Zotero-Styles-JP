# About
## Zotero styles for Japanese publications
This is a repository for Zotero styles used by several Academic Societies I belong to. I originally created these styles for personal use but considered sharing them to benefit more people. \
It also includes the python scripts I used to generate each style. I am cleaning the code from time to time. I will add new styles as they become available. I did my best to rigorously follow the guidelines of the societies but in doubt please see the societies' manuals and edit accordingly.\
These styles can be used if you write in English, Japanese or both. Due to limitations (style specifications and how Zotero handles the styles), no other languages can be added (not easily anyway). Due to the way the style is written it is not eligible to be submitted to Zotero style repository either.\
I created these styles because I want to stick with Zotero. However, if you are in need for more control with multilingual citations and bibliography, please consider checking Juris-m (https://juris-m.github.io/).

## Africa Educational Research Journal
In this folder, you will find the (unofficial) styles for the Africa Educational Research Journal, a journal of the Japan Society for Africa Educational Research. I have only set the bibliography and citation for book, book chapter, and journal article following the note to contributors. I have aditionally added style for web page. \

## Use
* For each entry in Japanese, please add "name-kana:ひらがな" into the extra field (ひらがな： hiragana reading of the first author's name). The style uses this information to format and sort Japanese entries.
* If the extra field already contains other information, please add a line break and write on the next line.
* Enjoy adding citations and bibliography normally.

# Disclaimer
I am just sharing the csl files I used for my own publications. This repository is not affiliated with the journal or the academic society. Always manually check the display before submitting. Anything not supported by the style should be edited by hand. I will put them in the todo list for the next version. \
This style may change in the future, in a way that you may have to change the value of extra, should you plan to update to the latest version later. This is due to the change in availability of accepted syntax in the csl format.
