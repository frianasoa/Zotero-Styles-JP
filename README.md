# About
## Zotero styles for Japanese publications
This is a repository for Zotero styles used by several Academic Societies. It also includes the python scripts I used to generate each style. I am cleaning the code from time to time. I originally created these styles for personal use but considered sharing them to benefit more people. I will add new styles as they become available. I did my best to rigorously follow the guidelines of the societies but in doubt please see the societies' manuals and edit accordingly. 

## Africa Educational Research Journal
In this folder, you will find the styles for the Africa Educational Research Journal, a journal of the Japan Society for Africa Educational Research. I have only set the bibliography and citation for book, book chapter, and journal article. \

# Disclaimer
I am just sharing the csl files I used for my own publications. This repository is not affiliated with the journal or the academic society. Always manually check the display before submitting. Please let me know if you find issues with the style. I will put them in the todo list for the next version.
